# AgileGAN
Official repo for paper "AgileGAN: Stylizing Portraits by Inversion-Consistent Transfer Learning"
Code are published in the supplementary at https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450626.3459771. 
Due to company IP policy, I am sorry that dataset, training code and model might not be able to release.
However, you can use third-party implementation to get similar results. https://github.com/open-mmlab/MMGEN-FaceStylor 
If you would like me to run some comparison result, I am happy to help.
